# typojoin

Deterministic, typo-tolerant joins for structured keys.

`typojoin` reconciles data frames that *should already match* except for
minor formatting differences or small alphabetical typos.

It is designed for safe, predictable key harmonization — not general fuzzy matching.

---

## What typojoin does

- Normalizes case, spacing, and selected punctuation  
- Performs exact matching first  
- Resolves remaining keys using string distance  
- Enforces a single best match per record  
- Optionally asserts complete reconciliation  

---

## What typojoin does not do

- It is not a probabilistic fuzzy join framework  
- It does not return similarity scores for exploratory matching  
- It does not attempt multi-column heuristic reconciliation  
- It is not designed for large Cartesian search problems  

---

## Example

```{r example, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(typojoin)
library(tibble)

correct <- tibble(
  industry = c("Daycare", "Construction"),
  value = c(1, 2)
)

wrong <- tibble(
  industry = c("Daycaer", "Construction"),
  value = c("A", "B")
)

typo_inner_join(correct, wrong, "industry")
```

---

## Why not fuzzyjoin?

`fuzzyjoin::stringdist_join()` is flexible and powerful.

`typojoin` is intentionally narrower:

- deterministic  
- single best match resolution  
- exact-first logic  
- production-friendly reconciliation  

If your data should already align except for small human errors,
`typojoin` provides safer defaults.

## Installation

```r
install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("bcgov/typojoin")
```

---

`typojoin` is built for pipelines where key alignment is expected — but humans are involved.
