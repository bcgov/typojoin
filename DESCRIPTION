Title: Deterministic, Typo-Tolerant Joins for Structured Keys
Version: 0.2.0

Description: Provides a deterministic, typo-tolerant join for data frames
    that should already align except for minor formatting differences or
    small alphabetical errors. Keys are specified explicitly as character
    column names. The function applies normalization, performs exact
    matching first, and resolves remaining discrepancies using string
    distance with a single best match per record. Designed for predictable,
    production-friendly key reconciliation rather than general fuzzy matching.
